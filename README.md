## Scraped Stack-Overflow Survey Data

This is an attempt to scrap the [stack overflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/) and fetch the data. It is just meant for learning python. The project doesn't scrape the entire survey but most of the data related to tech.

Scraped Dataset:

- Stack-Overflow Survey 2022 
  - [CSV](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/scraped-stackoverflow-survey/survey-2022/dataset/data.csv)
  - [JSON](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/scraped-stackoverflow-survey/survey-2022/dataset/data.json)

The scraping of the survey results was done with Python. Libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests were used for the core fetching and scraping of the survey results.
